# 07-01-barcamp

This is the next phase of the original BarCamp Assignment. You should do this project in a new folder (maybe called 07-01-barcamp-v2), but you can reuse anything you like from the first phase. (Some of it might not be applicable anymore though.)

The assignment is the same: Build a website according to the comps.

There are two major differences:

1. The website should not be a fixed-width website of 370px. It should still be mobile-only, but it should scale within a range of ~370px to ~460px.
2. You should use the Google Font called "Rokkit" to get the fonts looking closer to the actual website.
To accomplish the first goal above, you'll need new assets. The assets you will be working with this time around are not sized for a 370px-wide screen. Instead, the are the actual assets used on the BarCamp website. So they're larger than you need, because they were designed to fill available space.

This will make the job considerably harder. You'll find some of the assets you used in the first phase are in this phase actually many assets that are layered atop each other. There will also simply be more CSS to write.

You may use the following banned CSS properties/values for this assignment:

* position (with relative and absolute as a value)
